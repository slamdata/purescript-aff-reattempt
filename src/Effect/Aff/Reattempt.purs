-- | `reattempt` repeatedly attempts to run the provided `Aff` until either an attempt
-- | succeeds or the provided timeout elapses.
-- |
-- | After the timeout elapses no more attempts will be made but the last attempt will
-- | not be cancelled. Each attempt either fails or succeeds. The timeout has no effect on
-- | the outcome of an attempt.
-- |
-- | When an attempt to run the provided `Aff` succeeds the `Aff` returned by `reattempt`
-- | will succeed. When no attempts succeed the `Aff` returned by `reattempt` will fail
-- | with the `Error` raised by the last attempt.
